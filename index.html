During my teaching career, which has spanned over 20 years, I have had the opportunity to work with learners with a range of needs. These include: Profound and Multiple Learning Difficulties, Severe Learning Difficulties, and those with Specific Learning Difficulties, including Autism and ADHD. Having worked in both mainstream and special school settings, I have a good understanding of the complexities of different needs that a pupil or client may present with, both in the school setting and their home environment. I believe strongly that everyone is unique and has strengths in different areas, therefore detailed background information will be gathered to build the big picture and recommendations will be made to help ensure an individual can reach their potential. I have completed the OCR Level 7 Diploma in Teaching and Assessing Learners with Dyslexia/Specific Learning Difficulties, hold an Assessors Practicing Certificate with PATOSS and am an approved assessor for the British Dyslexia Association. As a teacher and assessor, I am committed to my continued professional development. I regularly attend training to keep abreast of the latest developments in Specific Learning Difficulties and other Neuro-diversities such as Autism and ADHD. I also receive at least 30 hours of approved training in my specialist field (15 hours SASC approved) over three years.",

                        <p class="review-text">"Amy at Big Picture has been a real support for us whilst we support our daughter through a dyslexia diagnosis. She was incredibly quick to respond to our initial enquiries and also very happy to answer our questions both before and after the assessment. The location in Strixton is wonderfully peaceful and she made my daughter feel very at ease. The assessment and resulting report was very very thorough and has been incredibly helpful. Amy really went above and beyond by creating a tailored report specifically for sports coaches as well as the 'normal' education focussed report and I would highly recommend her for any other families who need help with possible dyslexia."</p>

Both of my children and I have been assessed for dyslexia by Amy at different times over the years, and every experience has been exceptional. Amy is both professional and personable, and she has a wonderful way of putting you at ease during what can feel like a very daunting process. Her calm, friendly approach and clear communication made each assessment feel manageable and supportive. I'm incredibly grateful for her expertise and would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone seeking a dyslexia assessment."</p>

I wanted to ensure someone assessed my daughter for dyslexia who had an understanding of Autism and ADHD also. Amy made my daughter feel so comfortable. The report was written in a timely manner and gave a huge insight into how my daughter learns, and what difficulties she has. Thank you so much. I would highly recommend."</p>

Each child was given a very detailed report, providing lots of helpful suggestions to support my children with their dyslexia. I have given the reports to the Senco at their school who has now ensured that the suggestions and additional measures have been put in place, particularly extra time and readers in tests. This is going to be valuable in their GCSE's so I am so pleased we went ahead and booked tests with Amy."</p>
